Click on the Register Button which will display the list of teachers available

Some courses have not been updated with the teacher names thus can't be registered for.


You can register from 60 classes.


Click the timetable button to see the current timetable, slots, teachers etc.

Use the drop down menu to filter courses based on the schools.



If you find courses clashing kindly select different slots as the slots you chose might be clashing with previously registered slots.
